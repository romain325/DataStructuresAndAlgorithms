# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort consists of iterations through the list comparing and switching adjacent elements to sort in the right order  
He is not really useful as it is a really greedy and unoptimised sorting algorithms  

## Complexity

| Condition | Time complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Best      | Î©(n)            |                  |
| Average   | O(n^2)          |                  |
| Worst     | O(n^2)          | O(1)             |
