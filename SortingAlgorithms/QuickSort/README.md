# Merge Sort

Based on the **DIVIDE AND CONQUER** logic, this algorithm takes a pivot in the middle and cut the array in half, does that until the array is short enough to be then merged at the right place.

## Complexity

| Condition | Time complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Best      | Ω(n log(n))     |                  |
| Average   | Ω(n log(n))     |                  |
| Worst     | O(n log(n))     | O(n)             |
