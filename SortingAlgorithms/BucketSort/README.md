# Bucket Sort

Bucket Sort split an array into multiple buckets containing a part of the data each sorted individually (recursively or with another algorithms) and then put all back in place.  
This algorithm is a distribution sorting algorithm.  

## Complexity

| Condition | Time complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Best      | Ω(n+k)          |                  |
| Average   | Ω(n+k)          |                  |
| Worst     | O(n^2)          | O(n)             |
