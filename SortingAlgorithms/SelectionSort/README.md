# Selection Sort

This algorithm is really greedy and unefficient on big amounts of data, he an be useful as he doesn't require a lot of external storage to run.  
His logic is creating a second list, going through the original list and finding the smallest value, adding it to the new list and repeat the process until the original list is empty.  

## Complexity

| Condition | Time complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Best      | O(n^2)          |                  |
| Average   | O(n^2)          |                  |
| Worst     | O(n^2)          | O(1)             |
