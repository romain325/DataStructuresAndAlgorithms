# Radix Sort

Radix Sort is a Non-Comparative Sorting algorithm, it distributs the elements in sub-buckets based on their radix.
The process is nearly similar to the [Bucket Sort](../BucketSort/README.md)

## Complexity

| Condition | Time complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Best      | Î©(nk)           |                  |
| Average   | O(nk)           |                  |
| Worst     | O(nk)           | O(n+k)           |
