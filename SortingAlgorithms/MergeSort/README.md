# Quick Sort

Based on the **DIVIDE AND CONQUER** logic, this algorithm takes a pivot and use it to make a partition to sort the new partition.
You can pick different types of pivot, a random one, the last or the first one.  

## Complexity

| Condition | Time complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Best      | Ω(n log(n))     |                  |
| Average   | Ω(n log(n))     |                  |
| Worst     | O(n^2)          | O(log(n))        |
