# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

----------------

A Collection of DataStructures And Algorithms in multiple languages.  
Most of them will be in C and we will add some more after.  

## How to learn from it

Each folder will follow a really basic structure:  

```bash
├── LinkedList
│   ├── assets1.jpg
│   ├── C
│   ├── CPP
│   ├── Java
│   └── README.md
```

The README.md contains the information about the particular DataStructure/Algorithm and will help you to understand it, if there is a pick in the README.md, it will be called assetsN.jpg/png !  

## Want to see a new structure/algo

If you want to see a new Structure or Algorithm, just add it as a Issue!  

## Contribution

If you want to contribute this would be amazing !  
Just make a Pull Request and follow the architecture said in the [*How to learn from it*]  
And add it to the the Index just below by linking the README.md !  

----------------

## Disclaimer

There are no perfect DataStructure or Algorithms, it does depends on the situation and the usage you'll make of it  
To make your decision, use the complexity tables that will help you find the one that matches you need!
