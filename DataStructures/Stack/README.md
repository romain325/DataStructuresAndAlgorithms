# Stack

![Stack](assets1.png)  

The Stack is a data structure following the LIFO pattern: **Last In First Out**  
We have multiple nodes linked to each other and we can easily add or remove element but only the first of the stack (the last one we added)

## Data Structure Operation Complexity  

| Condition | Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | -------- |  
| Average   | Θ(n)   | Θ(n)   | Θ(1)      | Θ(1)     |
| Worst     | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(1)      | O(1)     |
